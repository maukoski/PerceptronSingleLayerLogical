# Single Layer Perceptron Network

## Description

This project implements a single-layer perceptron network. The network is built and trained using the perceptron algorithm. The network consists of a layer of neurons, each having associated inputs and weights.

## Features

- Each neuron is represented as an instance of the `Neuron` class, which has attributes for input and weight.
- The network of neurons is represented by the `NeuronLayer` class. This class manages a collection of neurons, the input data, and performs the necessary computations for neuron activation.
- The network is trained through an iterative process that adjusts the weights of the neurons until a certain target accuracy is achieved.
